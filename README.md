# Oak ðŸŒ³

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/thesephist/oak.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/thesephist/oak)

**Oak** is an expressive, dynamically typed programming language. It takes the best parts of my experience with [Ink](https://dotink.co/), and adds what I missed and removes what didn't work to get a language that feels just as small and simple, but much more ergonomic and capable.

Here's an example Oak program.

```js
std := import('std')

fn fizzbuzz(n) if [n % 3, n % 5] {
    [0, 0] -> 'FizzBuzz'
    [0, _] -> 'Fizz'
    [_, 0] -> 'Buzz'
    _ -> string(n)
}

std.range(1, 101) |> std.each(fn(n) {
    std.println(fizzbuzz(n))
})
```

Oak has good support for asynchronous I/O. Here's how you read a file and print it.

```js
std := import('std')
fs := import('fs')

with fs.readFile('./file.txt') fn(file) if file {
    ? -> std.println('Could not read file!')
    _ -> print(file)
}
```

Oak also has a pragmatic [standard library](https://oaklang.org/lib/) that comes built into the `oak` executable. For example, there's a built-in HTTP server and router in the `http` library.

```js
std := import('std')
fmt := import('fmt')
http := import('http')

server := http.Server()
with server.route('/hello/:name') fn(params) {
    fn(req, end) if req.method {
        'GET' -> end({
            status: 200
            body: fmt.format('Hello, {{ 0 }}!'
                std.default(params.name, 'World'))
        })
        _ -> end(http.MethodNotAllowed)
    }
}
server.start(9999)
```

## Install

On macOS, Oak can be installed through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```sh
brew install oak
```

On other platforms or macOS without Homebrew, check the [installation guide](https://oaklang.org/#start) on the Oak website to install the Oak CLI or build it from source.

## Overview

Oak has 7 primitive and 3 complex types.

```js
?        // null, also "()"
_        // "empty" value, equal to anything
1, 2, 3  // integers
3.14     // floats
true     // booleans
'hello'  // strings
:error   // atoms

[1, :number]    // list
{ a: 'hello' }  // objects
fn(a, b) a + b  // functions
```

These types mostly behave as you'd expect. Some notable details:

- There is no implicit type casting between any types, except during arithmetic operations when ints may be cast up to floats.
- Both ints and floats are full 64-bit.
- Strings are mutable byte arrays, also used for arbitrary data storage in memory, like in Lua. For immutable strings, use atoms.
- Lists are backed by a vector data structure -- appending and indexing is cheap, but cloning is not
- For lists and objects, equality is defined as deep equality. There is no identity equality in Oak.

We define a function in Oak with the `fn` keyword. A name is optional, and if given, will define that function in that scope. If there are no arguments, the `()` may be omitted.

```js
fn double(n) 2 * n
fn speak {
    println('Hello!')
}
```

Besides the normal set of arithmetic operators, Oak has a few strange operators.

- The **assignment operator** `:=` binds values on the right side to names on the left, potentially by destructuring an object or list. For example:

    ```js
    a := 1              // a is 1
    [b, c] := [2, 3]    // b is 2, c is 3
    d := double(a)      // d is 2
    ```
- The **nonlocal assignment operator** `<-` binds values on the right side to names on the left, but only when those variables already exist. If the variable doesn't exist in the current scope, the operator ascends up parent scopes until it reaches the global scope to find the last scope where that name was bound.

    ```js
    n := 10
    m := 20
    {
        n <- 30
        m := 40
    }
    n // 30
    m // 20
    ```
- The **push operator** `<<` pushes values onto the end of a string or a list, mutating it, and returns the changed string or list.

    ```js
    str := 'Hello '
    str << 'World!' // 'Hello World!'

    list := [1, 2, 3]
    list << 4
    list << 5 << 6 // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    ```
- The **pipe operator** `|>` takes a value on the left and makes it the first argument to a function call on the right.

    ```js
    // print 2n for every prime n in range [0, 10)
    range(10) |> filter(prime?) |>
        each(double) |> each(println)

    // adding numbers
    fn add(a, b) a + b
    10 |> add(20) |> add(3) // 33
    ```

Oak uses one main construct for control flow -- the `if` match expression. Unlike a traditional `if` expression, which can only test for truthy and falsy values, Oak's `if` acts like a sophisticated switch-case, comparing values until the right match is reached.

```js
fn pluralize(word, count) if count {
    1 -> word
    2 -> 'a pair of ' + word
    _ -> word + 's'
}
```

This match expression, combined with safe tail recursion, makes Oak Turing-complete.

Lastly, because callback-based asynchronous concurrency is common in Oak, there's special syntax sugar, the `with` expression, to help. The `with` syntax sugar de-sugars like this.

```js
with readFile('./path') fn(file) {
    println(file)
}

// desugars to
readFile('./path', fn(file) {
    println(file)
})
```

For a more detailed description of the language, see the [work-in-progress language spec](docs/spec.md).

### Builds and deployment

While the Oak interpreter can run programs and modules directly from source code on the file system, Oak also offers a build tool, `oak build`, which can _bundle_ an Oak program distributed across many files into a single "bundle" source file. `oak build` can also cross-compile Oak bundles into JavaScript bundles, to run in the browser or in JavaScript environments like Node.js and Deno. This allows Oak programs to be deployed and distributed as single-file programs, both on the server and in the browser.

To build a new bundle, we can simply pass an "entrypoint" to the program.

```sh
oak build --entry src/main.oak --output dist/bundle.oak
```

Compiling to JavaScript works similarly, but with the `--web` flag, which turns on JavaScript cross-compilation.

```sh
oak build --entry src/app.js.oak --output dist/bundle.js --web
```

The bundler and compiler are built on top of my past work with the [September](https://github.com/thesephist/september) toolchain for Ink, but slightly re-architected to support bundling and multiple compilation targets. In the future, the goal of `oak build` is to become a lightly optimizing compiler and potentially help yield an `oak compile` command that could package the interpreter and an Oak bundle into a single executable binary. For more information on `oak build`, see `oak help build`.

### Performance

As of September 2021, Oak is about 5-6x slower than Python 3.9 on pure function call and number-crunching overhead (assessed by a basic `fib(30)` benchmark). These figures are worst-case estimates -- because Oak's data structures are far simpler than Python's, the ratios start to go down on more realistic complex programs. But nonetheless, this gives a good estimate of the kind of performance (or, currently, the lack thereof) you can expect from Oak programs. It's not fast, though anecdotally it's fast enough for me to have few complaints for most of my use cases.

Runtime performance is not currently my primary concern; my primary concern is implementing a correct and pleasant interpreter that's fast _enough_ for me to write real apps with. Only when speed becomes a problem for software I built with Oak will I really invest much more in speed. I think being as fast as Python and Ruby is a good goal, long-term. Those languages run in production and receive continuous investments into performance tuning, but are far more complex. Oak is much simpler, but it's also just me. I think it evens out the difference.

There are several immediately actionable things we can do to speed up Oak programs' runtime performance, though none are under works today. In order of increasing implementation complexity:

1. Basic compiler optimization techniques applied to the abstract syntax tree, like constant folding and propagation.
2. A thorough audit of the interpreter's memory allocation profile and a memory optimization pass (and the same for L1/L2 cache misses).
3. A bytecode VM that executes Oak compiled down to more compact and efficient bytecode rather than a syntax tree-walking interpreter.

## Development

Oak (ab)uses GNU Make to run development workflows and tasks.

- `make run` compiles and runs the Oak binary, which opens an interactive REPL
- `make fmt` or `make f` runs the `oak fmt` code formatter over any _files with unstaged changes in the git repository_. This is equivalent to running `oak fmt --changes --fix`.
- `make tests` or `make t` runs the Go test suite for the Oak language and interpreter
- `make test-oak` or `make tk` runs the Oak test suite, which tests the standard libraries
- `make test-bundle` runs the Oak test suite, bundled using `oak build`
- `make test-js` runs the Oak test suite on the system's Node.js, compiled using `oak build --web`
- `make build` generates release builds of Oak for various operating systems; `make build-<OS>` builds for a specific OS
- `make install` installs the Oak interpreter on your `$GOPATH` as `oak`, and re-installs Oak's vim syntax file
- `make site` builds an Oak bundle for the [oaklang.org](https://oaklang.org/) website, amd `make site-w` does it on every file save
- `make site-gen` rebuilds the statically generated parts of the Oak website, like the standard library documentation

To try Oak by building from source, clone the repository and run `make install` (or simply `go build .`).

## Unit and generative tests

The Oak repository so far as two kinds of tests: unit tests and generative/fuzz tests. **Unit tests** are just what they sound like -- tests validated with assertions -- and are built on the `libtest` Oak library with the exception of Go tests in `eval_test.go`. **Generative tests** include fuzz tests, and are tests that run some pre-defined behavior of functions through a much larger body of procedurally generated set of inputs, for validating behavior that's difficult to validate manually like correctness of parsers and `libdatetime`'s date/time conversion algorithms.

Both sets of tests are written and run entirely in the "userland" of Oak, without invoking the interpreter separately. Unit tests live in `./test` and are run with `./test/main.oak`; generative tests are in `test/generative`, and can be run manually.
